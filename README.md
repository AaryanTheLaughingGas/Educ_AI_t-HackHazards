# 🧠 Educ_AI_t 📖

> Making learning _SOUND_ like never before!

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

This application aims at providing the simplest learning tool for not just **accessibility** users, but even you and me!
All _teachers_ and _parents_ have to do is, upload soft-copies of their learning materials on the app, and use the intelligent **RAG-Multi-Modal** AI assistant 
to help students learn limitlessly with their personal AI tutor!

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Python
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Create the following API Keys: <br>
  ```Groq API Key: https://console.groq.com/keys```<br>
  ```LlamaIndex API Key: https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/```<br>
  ```Qdrant API Key: https://cloud.qdrant.io/```

- .env file setup:
  Once you've created your API keys, create a ```.env``` file (inside 📁llamaparser-example) <br> and add the following variables with your keys 🔑:
  ```
  LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY= ""
  QDRANT_API_KEY= ""
  QDRANT_URL= ""
  GROQ_API_KEY= ""
  GROQ_og_API_KEY= "" (I've used 2 Groq API keys just for safety, you can replace and keep just one key in streamlit_app.py and local_deployment_app.py 😊)
  ```

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AaryanTheLaughingGas/Educ_AI_t-HackHazards.git

# Create Virtual Environment in Python
# For Windows
python -m venv Cyberviz
.\Cyberviz\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd llamaparser-example
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Streamlit server
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
