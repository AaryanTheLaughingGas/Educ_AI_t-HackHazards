# 🧠 Educ_AI_t 📖

> Making learning _SOUND_ like never before!

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

This application aims at providing the simplest learning tool for not just **accessibility** users, but even you and me!
All _teachers_ and _parents_ have to do is, upload soft-copies of their learning materials on the app, and use the intelligent **RAG-Multi-Modal** AI assistant 
to help students learn limitlessly with their personal AI tutor!

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Python
- Create the following API Keys:
  > Groq API Key: https://console.groq.com/keys
  > LlamaIndex API Key: https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/
  > Qdrant API Key: https://cloud.qdrant.io/
  > 
- .env file setup:
  Once you've created your API keys, rename the ```sampler.env``` file as ```.env``` and replace the following placeholders:
  > LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY= ""
  > QDRANT_API_KEY= ""
  > QDRANT_URL= ""
  > GROQ_API_KEY= ""
  > GROQ_og_API_KEY= "" (I've used 2 Groq API keys just for safety, you can replace the main_app.py code with just one key also 😊)

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AaryanTheLaughingGas/Educ_AI_t-HackHazards.git

# Create Virtual Environment in Python
# For Windows
python -m venv Cyberviz
.\Cyberviz\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd llamaparser-example
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Streamlit server
streamlit run main_app.py
```
